Overview

Aim
---

The aim of this series of documents is to outline *one* way of getting
started with Linux kernel programming. It is by no means the only way
and it is quite possibly not even the *best* way.

Good luck.

Assumptions
-----------

1. You are inherently interested in how the Linux kernel works.
2. You know the C programming language *well*.
3. You know how to use git.
