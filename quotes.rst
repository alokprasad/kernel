Amusing Kernel Quotes
=====================

- Fire up your editor and come join us; you will be more than welcome.

- Printf should not be used for chit-chat

- If I could give you one piece of advice: never sleep with anyone crazier than
  yourself. But if I had to give you advice on locking: keep it simple.

- Deadlocks are problematic, but not as bad as data corruption. Code which grabs
  a read lock, searches a list, fails to find what it wants, drops the read
  lock, grabs a write lock and inserts the object has a race condition.

  If you don't see why, please stay the fuck away from my code.

  (Linus)

- This conversation is unreal. Just remove the misguided assert and
  you're good. After that, please have someone explain basic reference
  counting to you.
