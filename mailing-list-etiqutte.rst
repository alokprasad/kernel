Linux Kernel Mailing List Etiquette
===================================

Kernel developers are on email *all* day. They have developed a set of
procedures that facilitate this with ease. Here are some things you
may find useful.

- Miscellaneous newbie questions go to kernelnewbies mailing
  list. Specific *intelligent* questions relating to a kernel subsystem
  go to the subsystem mailing list. If you are new you almost certainly
  do not want to post to LKML.

- All kernel development is done in the open, this means via
  mailing lists. Always maintain the complete CC list when responding
  to mailing list mail. Never email a kernel developer [about kernel
  development] 'in private' i.e without CC'ing a mailing list.

- You will make mistakes, doing so is very hard on the ego, you are
  going to have to deal with it.  

- Never top post, see https://daringfireball.net/2007/07/on_top  

- Be polite. Please, thank you etc. No one *has* to respond to you, if
  they do so acknowledge their response.

- Wait at least two weeks before following up on a previous email/patch.

- State your position clearly in as well a thought out, and researched
  manner as possible.
  
- Always use correct grammar, spelling and punctuation to the best of
  your ability. If English is your first language then make the effort
  to write it correctly.

- Do not argue with reviewers. This cannot be overstated. Sure,
  reviewers make mistakes but if you are new to kernel development
  then you are almost certainly wrong.

- Try to learn the first time someone tells you something. If you
  really cannot understand, by all means ask for clarification. If you
  still don't get it, go away and read up, people are usually happy
  to point you towards further reading on the topic. No one likes
  saying the same thing three times.
