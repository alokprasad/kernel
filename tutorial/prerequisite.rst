Tutorial Prerequisites
======================

1. Clone Greg Kroah-Hartman's staging tree

   .. code:: bash

   	git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git

2. Build the staging kernel

  NOTE: The tutorial is presented as two tracks of differing difficulty. If you don't want to wait
  for the kernel to build during the tutorial and you think you will attempt the easier of the two
  tracks then you should checkout the 4.9 kernel and build it.

  .. code:: bash

   	git checkout -b tutorial 69973b8
