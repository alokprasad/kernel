Hacking Device Drivers - How to get into kernel development
===========================================================

Workshop - Open Source Summit North America 2019

Presented by: Tobin C. Harding <me@tobin.cc>

Welcome to the workshop, thank you for giving up your time to come here.  For
the workshop we will be hacking on staging drivers within the kernel tree.

The aim of the workshop is to get everyone to submit a three patch series to
LKML.  Like all fun projects the workshop should be challenging but achievable.
In order to achieve this there are multiple projects.  Please pick the one that
looks the most enjoyable to you.  Please consider working in a group of two or
three, pair programming is fun and you will almost certainly learn something
from each other.

All projects require the same set up to get started, please see `./setup.rst`.

Once you have a kernel built (or building) please select from one of the
following (listed in order of complexity).

1. checkpatch your way to glory: `./checkpatch.rst`

2. Probe and release: `./probe-and-release.rst`

3. Sparse, spatch, and Coccinelle: `./further-tools.rst`
